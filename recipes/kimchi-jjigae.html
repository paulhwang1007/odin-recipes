    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Kimchi jjigae is a hearty and comforting Korean stew that highlights the bold flavors of kimchi, a staple fermented vegetable dish in Korean cuisine. Typically prepared with aged kimchi, which has a stronger, tangier flavor, the stew is simmered with pork, tofu, onions, and often other vegetables like zucchini or mushrooms. The base of kimchi jjigae is a rich broth made from anchovy stock or sometimes pork or beef broth, infused with the pungent and spicy notes of kimchi.</p>
    <p>Seasonings such as gochugaru and gochujang add depth and a mild heat to the stew, creating a robust and savory dish that warms both the body and soul. Kimchi jjigae is typically served bubbling hot in a communal pot, accompanied by a bowl of steamed rice, and enjoyed with various banchan, embodying the essence of Korean comfort food.</p>
